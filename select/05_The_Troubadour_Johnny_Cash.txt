Troubadour

(Troubadour)

The troubadour, the troubadou
Sings from his heart
The song that's the hit of the show (troubadour)
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar
Alone in the bright spotlight's glow (troubadour)

The song was for someone he loved so true
Who loved him then left him for someone new
The troubaour, the troubadour
Smile as he sings
But his heart is breaking in two

They beg for more the troubadour
Sings once again
The song that's the hit of the show (troubadour)
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar
Alone in the bright spotlight's glow (troubadour)

There is a hush in the darkened hall
A few hearts are heavy and teardrops fall
But in the crowd one head is bowed for the troubadour
And oh her heart aches most of all

Troubadour, troubadour
Her heart aches most of all
