I still feel 25, most of the time.
I still raise a little cain with the boys.
Honky tonks and pretty women.
Lord I'm still right there with them.
Singing above the crowd and the noise.

Sometimes I feel like Jesse James,
Still trying to make a name.
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am.
I was a young troubadour, when I rode in on a song.
And I'll be an old troubadour, when I'm gone.

Well, The truth about a mirror, It's that a damned old mirror,
Don't really tell the whole truth.
It don't show what's deep inside, or read between the lines,
It's really no reflection of my youth.

Sometimes I feel like Jesse James,
Still trying to make a name.
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am.
I was a young troubadour, when I rode in on a song.
And I'll be an old troubadour, when I'm gone.

I was a young troubadour, when I rode in on a song.
I'll be an old troubadour, when I'm gone.
I'll be an old troubadour, when I'm gone.
