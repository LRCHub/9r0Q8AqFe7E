I've got somethin' to say
I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

I've got somethin' to say
I raped your mother today and it
Doesn't matter much to me
As long as she spread

These lovely dead
I'm waiting for your breath
'Cause sweet Death wants Last Caress.

These lovely dead
I'm waiting for your breath
'Cause sweet Death wants Last Caress.

These lovely dead
I'm waiting for your breath
'Cause sweet Death wants Last Caress.

One Last Caress today
